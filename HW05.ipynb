    "To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes' method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).\n",
    "- Initially, let p equal 2, the smallest prime number.\n",
    "- Enumerate the multiples of p by counting to n from 2p in increments of p, and mark them in the list (these will be 2p, 3p, 4p, ...; the p itself should not be marked).\n",
    "- Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.\n",
    "- When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below n.\n",

    "Find all primes less than 1,000 using this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may use `numpy` and do not have to follow the algorithm exactly if you can achieve the same results."
